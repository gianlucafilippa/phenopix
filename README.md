# phenopix
Here's the github repo of the phenopix R package. The package provides a suite of functions designed to process digital repeat images such as phenocam images (check the US PhenoCam project), post process vegetation indices (VIs) time series and render the results. Check my research gate page and phenopix vignettes for details.
